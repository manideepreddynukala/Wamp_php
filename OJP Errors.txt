support unique prefix keys.
after selecting PRIMARY KEY when you create table, don't input any value in pop dialog

3)Unknown column 'name' in 'field list'
Check the names of your column
                                    back quotes are important

$run=mysqli_query($conn, "INSERT INTO `table_1` (`id`, `name`, `gender`, `dob`,`mobile`,`password`) -->These names should be same as your table column names
                    VALUES ('$id', '$name', '$gender', '$dob','$mobile','$password')");
					
					
					
4) Deprecated: mysql_connect(): The mysql extension is deprecated and will be removed in the future: use mysqli or PDO instead
The way with MySQLi would be like this:

<?php
$connection = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'username', 'password', 'database');
To run database queries is also simple and nearly identical with the old way:

<?php
// Old way
mysql_query('CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `table`', $connection);
// New way
mysqli_query($connection, 'CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `table`');
Turn off all deprecated warnings including them from mysql_*:

<?php
error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_DEPRECATED);
